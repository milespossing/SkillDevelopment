# Skill Development

## Introduction

My name is Miles Possing and this is where I'm housing all the code I'm using to improve my skills as a developer. There will be several projects in here ranging from heavy object oriented structures and tests in c# to Project Euler solutions in python to small UI tools built in who knows what to web sites and services built with ASP.NET or django.

I'm placing this repo as a public repo on github to help give you an idea of who I am as a developer, how I learn and work, and what I'm capable of. I'd also like to keep myself accountable.

## Interesting Technologies I'd like to work on

- ASP.NET
- Django
- WPF
- WCF
- Some form of RESTful API
- Xamarin apps for android (and later iOS)
- General Python Programming
- Javascript, Node.js, React, etc. (more web perhaps)
- Azure

## Currently Working On:

*Docker*: Learning a lot about docker. I have SQL server environments running in docker which can be accessed through data grip (which is nice) so now I think I just have to do more with entity framework to get docker really rolling in the way I need it right now. The next step will be learning how to stack up multiple docker instances into a self-contained application. One example of this would be an instance of docker running SQL Server and another instance running ASP.NET and the two talking to one another. That would be really fun. Alternitively I could just use Azure for that.

*ASP.NET*: Building a very simple small groups app. It's really just a proof of concept, but it's an application for churches to keep track of a small groups system and their congregation from a data perspective.

*General Web Dev*: Working on a personal site/blog/resume/portfolio catchall kinda thing to hone my general web deb skills.

## Potential Project Ideas

- Sudoku solver - given a sudoku puzzle it solves it automatically. Good practice for input and output. Could use text files or web ui to enter data. Also some good algorithm development perhaps
- BLAST - app designed to help people with addiction and other destructive or undesireable behavior; based on the BLAST concept of Bored, Lonely, Anxious, Stressed, and Tired as triggers. Tracks these and allows users to contact other users when "On BLAST". Good potential mobile app with backend.
- Basic task manager and scheduler - allows users to schedule and plan a set of tasks within a set amount of time and schedules them automatically. Could also define dependent tasks, etc. and produce gantt charts? Good potential wpf app.
- Church Management System - could use django or asp.net (maybe I'd try django or node for this) to manage church membership, families, volunteerism, etc.
