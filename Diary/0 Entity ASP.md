# Entity, ASP.NET, and More

Whew! What a wild 2 weeks. I essentially been spending every free minute I've had learning about Entity Framework and poking around in ASP.NET. I'd say it's been pretty productive so far.

## Entity Framework

Entity Framework has been a blast. I decided to focus most of my efforts on EF Core as that seems to be the newest tech, as well as being cross platform. I'd say that I'm confident in the following:

1. Creating data models
2. Running code-first migrations
3. Defining data model relationships through code within the data model as well as through Fluent API (I'm a big fan of Fluent API)
4. Setting up ef core to use SqlServer
5. Using ef on simple projects such as console applications
6. Using a seperate class library which is consumable from different projects to control ef
7. Use .Include and other LINQ functions to get data out of ef as it's needed

## ASP.NET

ASP has definitely been more plodding around. I've been far more interested in working on ef as it relates to ASP.NET and using ASP.NET as a convenient view into how ef core works. I have gotten the chance, however, to scaffold controls directly from my data model, and work within the different views and controls to manipulate the database. This can be seen in the SmallGroupsSite/ Obviously ASP.NET is going to be a large undertaking. I am still questioning the validity of using ASP.NET in general, however. Maybe it's time I switch over to node and try to build a quick website backend there instead? Either that or I continue to work on ASP.NET for another month before moving over. It would be good to be comfortable in both given my background in C#.

## General Web Dev

I've also been trying to work on a personal website as a blog/resume (found under Web/PersonalSite) which is a simple ASP.NET site. I think I'm mainly going to use the site as a personal page and just stick to the one control. The hope here is that the site will give me a chance to improve on some of my web dev stuff. I don't see myself becoming a web developer, but it would be good to fill that part of me out and start to get away from .NET just a little bit.

## Next steps

I'm feeling pretty good about my ability to move forward on my Entity knowledge at this point. I think that I should try moving even further into the ASP.NET world. I think that I'm going to keep on building the small groups site. First things first I should make a couple of views and popup windows to add people to small groups. Then maybe I should try to make a document storage system? Finally the real challenge would be creating an api for small groups. That would set me up to do a lot of really cool stuff and RESTful API seems like a great thing to know about.

Looks like I have my next 2 weeks cut out for me.
